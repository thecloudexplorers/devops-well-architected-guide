# Checklists

Checklists provide practical evaluation tools to assess your current practices and identify areas for improvement. These serve as starting points for assessment and help translate design principles into actionable, measurable tasks.

## 3.1 Productivity Checklist

### Automation and Efficiency
- [ ] Is your CI/CD pipeline fully automated from code commit to production?
- [ ] Are code quality checks (linting, testing, security) automated in your pipeline?
- [ ] Do you use Infrastructure as Code for environment provisioning?
- [ ] Are repetitive manual tasks identified and automated?

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Can developers easily set up local development environments?
- [ ] Are build times optimized and feedback loops fast?
- [ ] Do you provide self-service capabilities for common tasks?
- [ ] Is documentation easily accessible and up-to-date?

### Metrics and Improvement
- [ ] Do you track and measure key productivity metrics (lead time, deployment frequency)?
- [ ] Are there regular retrospectives to identify improvement opportunities?
- [ ] Is there a culture of continuous learning and experimentation?

## 3.2 Collaboration Checklist

### Team Structure and Ownership
- [ ] Are teams cross-functional with shared goals and responsibilities?
- [ ] Is there clear ownership and accountability for different system components?
- [ ] Do teams have the necessary skills and autonomy to deliver end-to-end?

### Communication and Knowledge Sharing
- [ ] Are there established channels for both synchronous and asynchronous communication?
- [ ] Is knowledge documented and easily discoverable?
- [ ] Are there regular knowledge transfer sessions and learning opportunities?

### Culture and Trust
- [ ] Is there psychological safety to experiment and learn from failures?
- [ ] Are team members encouraged to provide and receive constructive feedback?
- [ ] Is there support for professional growth and skill development?

## 3.3 Application Security Checklist

### Security Integration
- [ ] Are security checks integrated into your CI/CD pipeline?
- [ ] Is security testing performed early and throughout the development cycle?
- [ ] Are security requirements considered during design and architecture decisions?

### Access Control and Data Protection
- [ ] Is the principle of least privilege applied to all system access?
- [ ] Are secrets and sensitive data properly managed and encrypted?
- [ ] Are there regular access reviews and permission audits?

### Monitoring and Response
- [ ] Is there continuous security monitoring and alerting in place?
- [ ] Are vulnerabilities regularly scanned and remediated?
- [ ] Is there an incident response plan that is regularly tested?

## 3.4 Governance Checklist

### Policies and Standards
- [ ] Are organizational policies clearly defined and communicated?
- [ ] Are policies automatically enforced where possible?
- [ ] Are there regular reviews and updates of governance policies?

### Compliance and Auditing
- [ ] Are audit trails maintained for all changes and access?
- [ ] Is compliance checking integrated into automated workflows?
- [ ] Are there regular compliance assessments and reporting?

### Risk Management
- [ ] Is there a risk-based approach to governance controls?
- [ ] Are governance controls balanced with team agility and autonomy?
- [ ] Are there clear escalation paths for policy exceptions?

## 3.5 Architecture Checklist

### Scalability and Performance
- [ ] Is the system designed to handle expected growth and load?
- [ ] Are performance requirements clearly defined and monitored?
- [ ] Are scaling strategies (horizontal/vertical) clearly planned?

### Resilience and Reliability
- [ ] Are there fault tolerance mechanisms in place?
- [ ] Is there a disaster recovery plan that is regularly tested?
- [ ] Are there monitoring and alerting systems for system health?

### Technology and Design
- [ ] Are technology choices appropriate for the use case and requirements?
- [ ] Is the architecture designed for maintainability and evolution?
- [ ] Are there clear boundaries and interfaces between system components?
