## 1. Domains Overview

These four domains represent the core areas of focus for any DevOps transformation. They provide the structure to assess maturity, identify gaps, and drive continuous improvement.

### 1.1 Culture & People

Fosters collaboration, shared responsibility, and a growth mindset across teams and leadership.

### 1.2 DevOps Agility

Enables rapid, reliable delivery through iterative processes, feedback loops, and adaptive planning.

### 1.3 Business Value

Aligns engineering efforts with strategic goals, measuring impact through outcome-driven metrics.

### 1.4 Automation & Tooling

Leverages automation, pipelines, and integrated toolchains to enhance speed, consistency, and security.
